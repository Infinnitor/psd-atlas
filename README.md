# psd-atlas

Tool for converting PSD files to sprite atlases. I created this because I wanted a quick way to turn PSD files from Procreate into tilemaps for games, doing it manually was very time consuming and finnicky. So I made this tool and am now sharing it here. Please note that if you plan to use this with PSD files generated by Procreate it will break, as there is some kind of bug in the `psd_tools` library that this project depends on. An easy workaround is to use another tool to open the PSD and re-export it, such as imagemagick (`magick file.psd file.psd`)
